# Bayesian Adaptive Regression Splines
This repository hosts a Matlab version of Bayesian Adaptive Regression Splines for Matlab, which is currently in danger of being lost. Currently, the once freely available code is no longer hosted. This repo aims to mitigate this. Please note that the Matlab version only allows for Poisson prior distributions for now. The R version (found here: https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~kass/bars/bars.html) allows for both Poisson and Normally distributed priors. The Poisson distribution, being Poisson, is particularly useful for neural spikes and similar arrival events. For theory and implementation, see the following papers:
